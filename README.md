# TLS Trust Anchor Identifiers

This repository contains a draft mechanism for negotiating certificate
trust anchors in TLS. For an overview, the informal [explainer](explainer.md)
document is a good starting point.

**Historical note:** This repository previously also contained [TLS Trust Expressions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-trust-expr/), which was an earlier design for the same problem. That design was replaced by Trust Anchor Identifiers, but some discussion remains as a point of comparison in the design space.
