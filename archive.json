MTC trust anchors are minted every hour\r\n2. MTC trust anchors naturally deactivate themselves\r\n\r\nProperty 1 means the manifest will grow over time and potentially get unwieldy. But property 2 implies an easy fix. Once an MTC trust anchor expires, there is no benefit to listing it in the manifest beyond historical interest. So we could potentially allow those to get trimmed. That will, in turn, allow trimming the old versions since they become empty. We have no way to express either of these, so we may want to add some allowance for this in the format.\r\n\r\nWe also don't necessarily need to do this here. Since the manifest document is consumed by just the root programs and CAs, who know what type of CA they are, we can always put this extra allowance in the MTC document. But it would be convenient if the changes slot nicely into the existing format, so we may want to look at this a bit.",

          "body": "Other than syntactic concerns (we'd need to start the counter later in the JSON document, or add a `version` key), I think the main consideration with pruning them is what happens to older RPs:\r\n\r\nA root program might stop really paying attention to old relying parties after, let's say, 1 year. (I'm making this number up.) E.g. If some Chrome hasn't taken software or component updates for so long, it's probably going to stay that way. Even if the private key of one of its CAs leaked online, if we cannot push code or config to those clients, we can't help them anyway.\r\n\r\nBut that says nothing about whether web servers care about serving those Chromes (and anyone else using the trust store version). That may happen for longer. Examples:\r\n\r\n* Maybe some old version of Chromium ended up in an old Electron that some popular apps are still using\r\n* Maybe this is on unupdated copy of WebView\r\n* Maybe this server is part of some enterprise deployment that has intentionally stayed on a very old Chrome\r\n* Maybe this server is just very popular and very risk-averse and doesn't want to stop serving those clients\r\n* Maybe this isn't Chromium at all, but and some other root program spun off, forked off of the Chrome list initially, and is still sending an old Chrome trust store name for compatibility while certs update their metadata.\r\n* Maybe this is some random IoT device that copied the root store as of some year and never updated it ever again\r\n\r\nCAs will need metadata about those old trust store versions for as long as they wish to serve subscribers that, in turn, which to serve these relying parties. In most of these cases, that schedule is completely detached from the root program that maintains the manifest.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't _really_ matter because the old versions are frozen and the CA can always just hold on to the old file before the root program stops trying to serve it. But I'm sure folks will mess this up, and it seems easier to not tempt fate if the growth isn't actually a problem. (Of course, if it is a problem, that's a whole different matter. I also wouldn't want to tempt fate if we think growth is fine and it turns out to be bad...)\r\n\r\nAside: There is arguably _a_ way to prune it as-is. It's just gross and terrible. :-) Just make a new trust store name. But this causes a minor bit of disruption at the transition point. (I think RPs would need to send trust expressions for both names for a spell.) Depending on how unforeseeable this unforeseen thing is, that can always been an option in a pinch. ",

If that task is half done by the software vendor and half done on the client device, that's the application's business, but we describe it as the relying party doing it.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that computing exclusions is a little tricky.

(You could imagine also checking the `certificate_authorities` extension, or other mechanisms.)\r\n* Due to this negotiation, the credentials are expected be exact certificate paths, with nothing extra or missing. In particular, this means it should be safe for the subscriber to check against the `signature_algorithms` and `signature_algorithms_cert` without worrying about stray MD2 self-signed roots.\r\n\r\nHowever, CertificatePropertyList is extensible, which is nice because it allows us to introduce other kinds of properties without changing the CA -> server software -> TLS library flow. It's basically a grab-bag of any kind of CA -> server software communication.\r\n\r\nBut this, combined with wanting to minimize how much layers in between need to inspect CertificatePropertyList puts us in a pickle: what does it mean if you get a CertificatePropertyList without any trust expression property? Maybe it's got some other property you don't understand. Does it still imply that it's still issuer-gated and a whole path?\r\n\r\nIf yes, the extensibility is less useful. There may well be use cases that don't want to be issuer-gated.\r\nIf no, we don't want the certificate to accidentally get interpreted as non-issuer-gated when it actually was issuer-gated by some other mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn writing this, I think I'm coming around to \"no\" being the right answer, but then...\r\n* Should the caller be required to call some \"this is an issuer-gated credential\" API? I.e. we use an out-of-band signal rather than relying on in-band signals that might disappear.\r\n* Do we have a general \"this is issuer-gated\" property and say everyone must understand this? That seems a bit weird.\r\n* Do we need to invent critical properties??? \ud83d\ude2d ",

This could be classical to post-quantum, or perhaps the current round of post-quantum algorithms to a future, more size-efficient one.\r\n\r\nThe subscribers keys will unavoidably require manual work by the subscriber. But everything beyond the subscriber key (what Merkle Tree Certificate's [BikeshedCertificate](https://davidben.github.io/merkle-tree-certs/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs.html#name-certificate-format) calls the \"proof\") is purely a matter between the CA and relying party. The subscriber *does not need to process them*. It would be nice if CAs could transparently start issuing you a classical-rooted certificate and a PQ-rooted certificate, and then certificate negotiation automatically takes care of it.\r\n\r\nIn particular, though this doesn't get the EE keys, a world with PQ roots and mixed PQ and classical EE keys is actually still coherent because we have a PQ-secure signal[*] that the site is not yet ready to be PQ-secure. Separating the transitions will be useful. And, of course, when transitioning between PQ-old-and-big vs PQ-new-and-small, the mix is straightforwardly coherent.\r\n\r\nWe *almost* have the pieces of this, except for one problem: X.509 is a bad fit for TLS. TLS uses code points, while X.509 negotiations with (sometimes [comically unusable](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4055.html)) AlgorithmIdentifiers. A TLS stack cannot map between them without recognizing the signature algorithm. This means CA signatures in X.509, unlike BikeshedCertificate, are *not* opaque to the subscriber. In particular, although very few folks implement it (without trust expressions, there are path-building problems), RFC 8446 technically [requires](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.4.2.2) the subscriber check this before presenting a certificate.\r\n\r\nWe can fix this by adding a `signature_algorithms` certificate property, that contains the CA-extracted codepoints in TLS syntax. If the property is present, the subscriber's TLS software should check those against the ClientHello in lieu of trying to parse this messy data out of the certificate.\r\n\r\n[*] Well, sort of. The existence of a P-256 certificate does not imply the non-existence of an ML-DSA certificate. We may need a bit more pieces to make that transition state viable.",

Instead, I think the right model is:\r\n\r\n* Here is how you use TE to get a positive signal of trust anchor match. TE might tell you \"yes, it matches\" or \"unknown\"\r\n* The `certificate_authorities` extension can also give you a similar signal.\r\n* Other extensions might be defined later to similarly handle trust negotiation\r\n* If any such extension says \"yes, it matches\", you have a trust anchor match. Otherwise it's unknown whether the server trusts the path.\r\n\r\nFrom there, the subscriber has free reign to decide how it selects a credential based on this \"trust anchor match\" signal. One possible scheme (but not the only one) is:\r\n\r\n* Subscriber maintains a list of credentials, in preference order, e.g. sorted by size or speed of signing key\r\n* Some credentials require a trust anchor match, presumably the ones at the front of the queue\r\n* Other credentials skip this check because they're fallback credentials, presumably the ones at the end of the queue\r\n* Pick the first credential that matches",

I don't see what benefit it would have, but some of the details don't make sense to me, so perhaps I am misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nFirst, the `certificate_authorities` extension doesn't carry certificates but names. So there wouldn't be a root certificate in the first place. Base64 encoding also sounds like unnecessarily wasteful (keep in mind we want a compact scheme), though one could use a new OCTET-STRING-carrying attribute. That would still be wasteful with the rest of the ASN.1 structure, but much less so.\r\n\r\nSecond, even though RFC 8446 does not prescribe a precise way to use the information, no one implements a trust expressions matching algorithm with it today. They'll all do some variation of checking for a matching issuer among the relying party's list, because those are the semantics of the field. The allowance is because there are lots of ways to do that and integrate it with other processes.\r\n\r\nIf we were to imbue an existing field with new semantics, we're going to need a code change in the TLS stack anyway. (And, to reduce server operator burden, I think it's important that the matching algorithm be in the TLS stack, at least long-term.) At that point, there is no cost to using a new extension, so we may as well define an extension with the right semantics.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a real cost to jamming new semantics into existing fields. In addition to the wasteful encoding, this risks weird behaviors when existing software interprets the field according to its existing semantics.",

I most certainly support your view that a server should have several cert chains available and adaptively select one pending information received by the client during TLS handshake. \r\n\r\nI therefore played around with a [much] simpler approach by sneaking information into the `certificate_authorities` extension. This explicitly not with the desire to increase agility, but to nevertheless help in the selection of the several available cert chains.\r\n\r\nAs a super simplified example, let's assume a \"fake\" root cert is built like this: \r\n```\r\nSIGALG_default=prime256v1\r\nopenssl ecparam -genkey \\\r\n                -name $SIGALG_default \\\r\n                -noout \\\r\n                -out CA_default.key \\\r\n&& \\\r\nopenssl req \\\r\n                -config /etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf \\\r\n                -key CA_default.key \\\r\n                -subj '/ST=I want purely QSC cert chain/L=Please use Germany as geo/CN=I want sec level 5' \\\r\n                -new \\\r\n                -x509 \\\r\n                -days 7300 \\\r\n                -extensions v3_ca \\\r\n                -out CA_default.crt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `-subj` line is the place where cert-chain-selection-hints are added. As you can see, I expect a reasonably small, highly pragmatic set of selection parameters\r\n- Legacy, QSC, Hybrid sigalgs\r\n- The geo will give a good hint about mandated algs \r\n- The security level is key for interactions with gov\r\n- Potentially some very few more \r\n\r\nFew comments to the above: \r\n- 'cost' is small: The above adds 110 Bytes to a `ClientHello` in the `certificate_authorities` extension and can be further reduced quite a bit by anyway preferred \"code points\" (`-subj '/ST=0x2345/L=Ox4444/CN=0x0005'` adds 57 bytes only) \r\n- Per request specification of `signature_algorithms` extension can not be expected to be easily supported by the gazillion of client apps, while a general description of what the client expects will not necessarily change between requests.\r\n- Implicitly, I'm expecting a gradual, but at least initially slow growth of CAs to support Q-safe root certs. Clients will then have two cert bundles, one legacy and one Q-safe. And it'll be the clients responsibility to have the 'usual suspects' CA for the features the client is asking in its cert bundle.\r\n- Yes, servers must implement code changes, but the clients not. \r\n\r\nAs for the specific use of \"fake root certs\" for the `certificate_authorities` extension in the TE context: In the mean time, I have the suspicion that the entries in your `trust_expressions` extensions might quite likely exceed (?) the max number of characters for the x509 fields transported via `certificate_authorities` extension. It would therefore not be a valid option for TE. \r\n",

Future credential types may also have a need for separately negotiable sub-parts.\r\n\r\nA brief sketch:\r\n\r\nFirst, allocate a trust anchor ID for each CT log.\r\n\r\nNext, define a `signed_certificate_timestamp` certificate property. It contains something like this. (Replace structure names with something more sensible.)\r\n\r\n```\r\nenum {\r\n    signed_certificate_timestamps(TBD), (2^16-1)\r\n} CertificatePropertyType;\r\n\r\nopaque SerializedSCT<1..2^16-1>;  // From RFC 6962\r\n\r\nstruct {\r\n    SerializedSCT sct;\r\n    TrustAnchorIdentifier trust_anchor;\r\n} SCTTrustAnchorPair;\r\n\r\nSCTTrustAnchorPair SCTTrustAnchorPairList<1..2^16-1>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, we make the trust anchors extension slightly richer. The client can send something like \"I want one of these, two of these, one of these\", etc. The server's advertisement should also be more structured (list of lists of trust anchors), because it needs to communicate \"I have one credential with proofs from A, B, C, another credential with proofs from C, D, E, and another with proofs from D, E, F\".\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// The client's half:\r\nstruct {\r\n    // Semantics: please give me some request_count of trust_anchors\r\n    uint8 request_count;\r\n    TrustAnchorIdentifier trust_anchors<1..2^16-1>;\r\n} TrustAnchorRequest;\r\n\r\n// Semantics: please satisfy *all* of these requests\r\nTrustAnchorRequest TrustAnchorRequestList<1..2^16-1>;\r\n\r\n// The server's half:\r\nstruct {\r\n    // Semantics: I have a credential with associated proofs from each of these trust anchors.\r\n    TrustAnchorIdentifier trust_anchors<1..2^8-1>;\r\n} AvailableCredential;\r\n\r\n// Semantics: I have each of these credentials available.\r\nAvailableCredential AvailableCredentialList<1..2^16-1>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can also go with a more bespoke SCT design, but the nice thing about this it enables other credential types (X.509 is very bad at it) to also have separately negotiable sub-parts.",

In looking at rebasing MTCs atop this, we realized that MTCs, since it induces many many individual trust anchors, will effectively only be deployable with the DNS mechanism.\r\n\r\nI think this isn't the end of the world, as MTCs are sufficiently long term that we may have gotten the DNS bits to work. But the original design sketch in MTCs had an extra component. Every certificate had not just an actual trust anchor ID but also a list of trust anchor aliases that also matched it.\r\n\r\nEssentially we were saying that [as long as the certificate isn't expired], any relying party that trusts this other ID can also be assumed to trust this ID. This is kind of a weird scenario for X.509 CAs, but it exactly fits the invariant for MTCs: a client that knows batch number 42 can be assumed to also know batch number 41, 40, etc., down to whatever batches have since expired.\r\n\r\nWe also don't have to do this in this draft and can instead introduce it in the MTCs draft. But it is a little tidier if we do it in the main one.\r\n\r\n(Design history: These aliases eventually grew into trust stores in trust expressions, but got those a lot more complicated to accommodate trust stores changing over time. The trust anchor IDs design tries to avoid that with the retry + DNS dance.)",

It's good to think about though.\r\n\r\n### Coding subsets of integers\r\n\r\n#### Theoretical limit\r\nFor the moment, let's simplify and assume trust anchors are numbers instead of OIDs. Say there are k=200 anchors with maximum value N=62,203 (number of PENs today). There are N *choose* k possible subsets of anchors to communicate. Thus, we cannot expect to code every subset with less than lg N choose k bits. We can approximate this well using [Stirling's approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation): 243 bytes.\r\n\r\n#### Rice coding\r\nWe can get quite close to this limit using a very simple method: [Rice coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golomb_coding) of differences. For each delta we compute *q = floor(d / 2^b)* and *r = d mod 2^b*, where *b = round(-lg(-lg(1-k/N))) = 8*. *q* is encoded in unary and *r* in binary, so 600 would be encoded as `0b11001011000`. The `110` encodes *q=2*; the remainder is the remainder *r*. The average size using Rice coding for random subsets is about 244.3 bytes with a 95th percentile of 244.8 bytes.\r\n\r\nRice coding doesn't take advantage of big gaps. If we want to code *{N-200, N-199, ..., N-1}* that takes 255.25 bytes.\r\n\r\n#### Huffman bitlength\r\nA different approach is to write each delta in two parts: first code its bitlength, and then to write the delta (without its most significant bit). For the bitlengths we can use a Huffman code, which can be compressed efficiently using canonical trees and delta coding of the code lengths as in bzip2. (Here is [an implementation](https://github.com/bwesterb/go-ncrlite).)\r\n\r\nFor random subsets this performs worse than Rice coding: 253 bytes on average with a 95th percentile of 255 bytes. However, it encodes *{N-200, N-199, ..., N-1}* in only 50 bytes, and there is room for improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If we assume we don't need to punch too many holes, splitting ranges in two isn't horrible. And you could periodically rebalance by numbers by allocating new aliases higher up the number space, trusting that newer certs are aware of it.

The server sends back the selected trust anchor (if match found) as `trust_anchors` extension, with exactly one entry in the first `CertificateEntry` of the `Certificate` message. \r\n  (As an optimization, we could introduce a separate extension only to be used in the `CertificateEntry` message that always contains exactly one entry. This would save two bytes for the length encoding.)\r\n- For negotiating the client certificate type, the server sends the supported Trust Anchors in the `CertificateRequest` message and would again retrieve the selected one as part of the `Certificate` message.\r\n\r\nThis approach has a few implications:\r\n- We need to have a unified representation of the certificate data in the `CertificateEntry` message to allow the application to interpret the data after it processed the extensions. See https://github.com/davidben/merkle-tree-certs/pull/95\r\n- It does increase the size of the extension placed in the `CertificateEntry` message, as it transmits the TAI instead of an empty extension. We could think of sending the TAI only for certificate types that are not X509, but that might complicate things.\r\n- It aligns server and client certificate type negotiation and therefore solves client certificate negotiation identified as a difficulty in [Merkle Tree Certificates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs-03#appendix-B)",

This does fall somewhat naturally from reusing the same TAI namespace between X.509 and Bikeshed (for completeness, we could have decided to just have a separate `bikeshed_trust_anchors` extension), but I suspect tying certificate format to trust anchor negotiation quite this tightly might be a bit too restrictive:\r\n\r\n* We might end up with multiple negotiation mechanisms. I mean, I hope not, but we already had two points in the trade-off space and #64 explores another one.\r\n* TAI's current design allows for the server to guess and for the client to retry if it's not happy. But if I see an unknown TAI, how do I know whether to check the contents (maybe it's an X.509 chain that I accept anyway) or not (maybe it's some non-X.509 format altogether)\r\n* For X.509, the relying party may have trust anchors that don't participate in TAI, either for privacy reasons or because there just isn't a TAI allocated. That's unlikely for Merkle Tree Certificates due to its strong dependency on negotiation, but maybe other bikeshed proof types or other cert formats will care.\r\n\r\nSo I suspect it'll be simplest if we keep the type explicit.",

Given that confusion, I think it's worth rephrasing this a bit to be more clear about the scope.

Perhaps we could go with the following, from lines 159 - 163:\r\n\r\nSince Certificate Transparency pairs certificates with SCTs issued from a third party, these timestamps can be used to measure the cutoff date, so the distrusted CA cannot backdate certificates in CT-enforcing clients. Since the existence of SCTs implies the corresponding certificate is present in multiple CT logs, the set of remaining trusted certificates is known and will decrease over time as certificates expire or are replaced. While this strategy is a useful tool, it is not a complete solution:\r\n\r\n* Not all distrusts present fact patterns that lend themselves to SCT-based distrust. For example, if too many certificates were misissued before the cutoff date, revocation lists may become too large to feasibly deliver to clients. Moving cutoff dates earlier risks additional breakage for sites unaffected by misissuance. During PKI transitions, root programs evaluate such tradeoffs, picking the approach that best suits the security needs of their users. \r\n\r\n* There are certain CA failure modes for which trusting certificates before a certain date is inappropriate. For example, a CA that has been performing domain validation incorrectly may have never issued a certificate correctly. Auditing the entire corpus of certificates issued from this CA to determine which were misissued may be infeasible due to both scale and changes in subscribers and domain ownership over time. \r\n\r\n* Clients that do not enforce Certificate Transparency are also still vulnerable to backdating, since such certificates would successfully validate without the SCTs present to indicate the incorrect issuance time asserted in the certificate.\r\n\r\n* Additionally, this strategy does not help server operators address challenge (2). The server must still switch to a replacement CA before the cutoff date, under the same constraints as in a more straightforward distrust. The following section discusses this further.\r\n",

Some overall comments:\r\n\r\nFor brevity, I think we can take it as read that if you generate a new root CA, you generate a new ID if you're participating in this mechanism.\r\n\r\nWe've actually never defined the client to having a preference between trust anchors. The client *can*, but it's a little goofy because only the server knows the sizes of the proofs and the performance of the corresponding keys, which is why we have a server preference list. Also, at the end of the day, the client doesn't care as long as it got a proof from _something_ it trusts.\r\n\r\nThe other complexity is that this draft covers both `certificate_authorities`-style selection and the client-selection one. But I think we can say what we're trying to say more succinctly and more generally.\r\n\r\nHow about this?\r\n\r\n1. The CA operator generates a new root CA with a separate key, but continues operating the old root CA.\r\n2. Root programs being trusting the new root CA alongside the old one, as a transition state. Both root CAs are configured to participate in trust anchor negotiation.\r\n3. When subscribers request certificates, the CA operator issues certificates from both roots and provisions the subscriber with both certificates.\r\n4. Trust anchor negotiation selects the old root for relying parties that only trust the old root, and the new root for relying parties that only trust the new root. In transition, relying parties that trust both may be served either, but prioritizing the new root helps monitor the transition.\r\n5. Once subscribers have been provisioned with new certificates, root programs can safely distrust the old root in new relying parties. The CA operator may continue to operate the old root CA for as long as it wishes to serve subscribers that, in turn, wish to serve older relying parties.",

But this has nothing to do with the negotiation scheme:\r\n\r\n* A server that uses `certificate_authorities` could well be configured with pre-built paths and only check the last certificate against the extension.\r\n\r\n* Conversely, a server that uses `trust_anchors` could well take a bag of certificates and path-build on the fly to expand that out into a bunch of candidate paths to send.\r\n\r\nPath-building discussions are mostly a distraction here.",

I think the conflict between availability and security might better be described as a corollary of the below problem statement, but I'm open to iterating over this if it's headed in the right direction.\r\n\r\n==========\r\nBackground:\r\nToday, TLS subscribers are provisioned with one or more certification paths which they use to authenticate themselves to TLS relying parties. Currently, TLS subscribers lack a reliable way of knowing which among these provisioned paths will be accepted by a given relying party, if any. Absent a clear signal, TLS subscribers are forced to guess, which causes connection failures when this guess is incorrect.\r\n\r\nIn the scenario in which a TLS subscriber wishes to authenticate itself to relying parties with distinct or mutually-exclusive trust settings, there is no single correct answer. Advanced TLS implementations may attempt to use TLS fingerprinting to make informed guesses; however, this is unreliable and client trust may change over time, causing existing fingerprinting mechanisms and the subsequent certification path selection to fail. \r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nTrust Anchor IDs and Trust Expressions present two different approaches to solve the same problem: eliminating the uncertainty around what relying parties trust so that TLS subscribers can obtain, and intelligently serve, a trusted certification path to TLS relying parties.\r\n",
